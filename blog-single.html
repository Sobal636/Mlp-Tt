<h2>When will Jesus return?</h2>
<p>
    Jesus will return shortly. No one, however, knows the exact hour when Jesus will return. "But no one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father," Mark 13:32 states. Interestingly, right before Jesus returned to heaven, the disciples asked Him the same question. Jesus told them at the time that they had no right to know the periods or seasons that were under the Father's power. As a result, Jesus could return tomorrow, next month, next year, or in 100 years. So, how does this affect you and I? Always be prepared for Jesus Christ's second coming.
    
    </p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h3>Why is it taking Jesus so long to return?</h3>   
<p>
    Because He is giving humanity as much time as possible to choose and follow Him, Jesus is patiently waiting to return. Jesus desires that as many people as possible repent and join Him in heaven. "But, beloved, remember this one thing: with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day," reads 2 Peter 3:8-9. The Lord is not slack in keeping His promise, as some consider slackness, but is patient with us, not wanting anyone to perish but all to come to repentance."</p>
</div>
<h3> Warnings about the second coming of Jesus?</h3> 
<p>
    Many people are confused by a variety of non-biblical views about Christ's second coming. Will He merely appear spiritually to a few people? Will Jesus' second coming take place exclusively in specific geographical locations? Is it possible that Jesus will emerge in the desert? In the last days, Jesus cautioned about deceptions. In fact, Jesus warns followers in Matthew 24:4-5 not to be fooled by those claiming to be Christ in the name of Jesus. As a result, our only safety net is to rely only on the Bible for answers.</p>

<h3> Will Jesus come back secretly?</h3> 
<p>
Many folks wonder how many individuals will witness Jesus' return. The second coming of Christ will be spectacular, dazzling, and loud. This event will not be disguised; Jesus will be seen by every human on the planet. He will return, both literally and personally. "Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him," says Revelation 1:7. There will be no one on the planet who is not aware of Jesus' return. Jesus Himself describes the method in which He will appear. According to Matthew 24:27, Christ's return will be like a bolt of lightning illuminating the entire sky from east to west.</p>

    <h2>Unity's Fundamental Principles</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout the Bible, the principle of unity is emphasised. The term "unity" refers to "a shared purpose" or "being one." The primary mission of the church is to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19–20); we are called to reach a lost and dying world. As a church, we are encouraged to work toward this goal. Individually, however, we must first be conformed to the image of Christ. As the body of Christ, we are called to have one mind and one mouth (Romans 15:5). Paul's goal was to stay focused on getting to know and growing in Jesus. We, like Paul, must keep our focus on Jesus and avoid worldly distractions that can cause the body to be divided. The church body can only be unified because of Jesus Christ and His death on the cross.
        
        </p>
    <div class="blockquote">
    <h3>Unity's Fundamental Principles</h3>   
    <p>
        Look at how good and pleasant it is for brothers to live together in peace! It's like the priceless ointment on Aaron's head, which ran down his beard to the skirts of his garments; it's like the dew of Hermon, and the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion, where the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore (Psalms 133:1–3). The unity of God's people is mentioned in this Psalm by David. Aside from the lovely description, there are important truths about unity revealed for the church.</p>
    </div>
    <h3> Unity is beneficial and enjoyable.</h3> 
    <p>
        Only God is good, according to Jesus (Mark 10:18). God is with us and flows through us when we are united. His presence is a blessing to us! Only unity can set a positive example for the rest of the world. When we work together as the body of Christ, we reduce the stress that comes with discord and opposition. A stress-free church is a byproduct of stress!</p>
    
    <h3> Like Precious Ointment, Unity</h3> 
    <p>
        Submission is symbolised by ointment flowing down the mountain. Without humility, there can be no unity; therefore, we must have the mind of Christ and the spirit of humility. Scripture warns us not to engage in strife and to think of others as better than ourselves (Philippians 2:3). God has given each of us a new nature, and humility, which leads to unity, is found in this nature. The ointment's fragrance represents the ointment's attractiveness in attracting others to God's presence. Our love for one another will show the world that we are Jesus' disciples (John 13:34–35). Our love for others must be holy, just like the oil. The yoke of enslavement will be broken by the holy anointing, which will influence unity. The formula for this oil was given to Moses directly from God, and it was only to be used for ministering in the Tabernacle. This speaks to the uniqueness of unity promised to the church alone, which the world cannot achieve (I Peter 2:9).

    </p>
    <h3> Like Dew, Unity</h3> 
    <p>
        Mt. Hermon is Palestine's highest mountain. It would receive so much moisture that it would be able to supply Israel with plenty of water. Dew will naturally cool the scorched, hot land. It will calm anger, tempers, and disagreements among God's people. This will assist us in overcoming our flesh, humbling ourselves, and uniting with the church. We're commanded to live as peacefully as possible with all men (Romans 12:18), and to enter the flow of God's presence.

    </p>
    <h3> Unity is pleasurable and results in blessings.</h3> 
    <p>
        If we seek unity within the church and with Jesus Christ, we will be granted eternal life. Heaven promises to complete our inheritance with the Lord and to keep His presence with us forever. But we don't have to wait until Heaven to enjoy these blessings; we can get a taste of them right now. Christ is in the midst of us, according to Scripture, when we're gathered in unity (Matthew 18:20). We don't have to be without Him while we're on this planet. Paul founded numerous churches and, in the latter part of his ministry, worked to persuade churches to live in unity. He wanted to make sure they didn't sin against one another or cause one another to stumble, but rather to love one another as Christ loved the church (I Corinthians 8:9–13). We must strive to keep the Spirit's unity in the bond of peace (Ephesians 4:13) and forgive one another (Colossians 3:13).

    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion
    </h3> 
    <p>
        We must be of one mind and compassionate toward one another (I Peter 3:8). Individuals and churches benefit from unity. The most important reason for us to live and unite is to save a lost and dying world. Let us seek unity and abide in God's presence every day. There is a soul in need of salvation.

        Unity is a state of harmony and oneness. In Christ, all believers are bound together. We have a relationship with Him and with every other believer in the world. "That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you," Jesus prayed for all who would believe in Him throughout the ages (John 17:21). Some have referred to the great divisions among Christian denominations as Christ's great "unanswered prayer," but Scripture clearly states that all believers are united with Christ because of our relationship with Him and with all other believers. We are all members of the same family, even if we don't always act like it. As a result, there are two aspects to unity in Christ: objective fact and subjective experience. Any number of groups, teams, or even families can achieve objective and subjective unity. A football team's members are bound together by their shared experience. They don't win or lose games on their own. Individuals contribute to the group, but the objective fact is that the group wins or loses. There may be times, however, when the team does not act in unison. Selfishness and rivalry may develop, and when they do, the team will be unable to function as a unit—this is the subjective aspect. Individual team members' behaviour does not correspond to the fact that they are united with each other. All believers are members of Christ's body, the church. This is stated clearly in the New Testament. "For we are members of his body," Ephesians 5:30 says plainly. Whether or not a Christian realises it, he or she is a member of Christ's body and thus united with all other believers. In 1 Corinthians 12:12–21, Paul uses the body as an analogy: "Just as a single body has many parts, but all of those parts combine to form one body, so it is with Christ. Because we were all baptised by the same Spirit to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the same Spirit to drink. When one part of the body fails, the entire body suffers. When a person smashes his thumb with a hammer, it hurts more than just the thumb. Other parts of the body may also hurt, and the overall function of the body is compromised. This is true even if the person is unaware of the malfunctioning component. Damage to the body can occur if an internal organ is not functioning properly, even if there is no pain or obvious illness. Similarly, the church is united in Christ. Each member of His body has a specific job to do and a place to call home. When one of the body's members fails to fulfil his or her role, the entire system suffers. Because of this unity, when one member acts in an individualistic or selfish manner (i.e., acts as if he is not a member of the body), the entire body suffers because, regardless of his actions, the individual member remains in unity with the rest of the body. Many New Testament commands call on Christians to live up to their calling and demonstrate their unity in Christ. Christians are not required to become one in Christ because that is already a fact. Christians are instructed to match their subjective experience to objective reality. "Therefore, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if you have any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind," Paul pleads with the Philippians. Do nothing out of conceit or selfish ambition. Instead, value others above yourself in humility, looking not to your own interests but to the interests of others" (Philippians 2:1–4). If Christians on the same team see themselves as competitors, they are not playing as teammates. They aren't living in the light of what already exists. If they are united in Christ, all believers are in a relationship with Christ and, by extension, with one another. All believers are linked together, whether they realise it, like it, or feel it. It is the task of Christian unity to live up to the truth of that reality. We must act as if we are all part of the same organism. This entails putting our individual needs second to the needs of the entire body, as well as putting our individual gifts to work for the greater good. Unity in Christ does not necessitate the abolition of all differences between churches or denominations. Individual churches and denominations can maintain their distinct identities and focuses while cooperating in areas where they agree. For example, an evangelical Baptist church and an evangelical Presbyterian church will agree on the gospel and the essentials of the faith, but due to differing beliefs about baptism, these two churches will not be able to join as one. It is possible for a church to take a neutral position on infant baptism; however, it is difficult to see how a church could teach both that parents should baptise their babies (as Presbyterian churches do) and that parents should not baptise their babies (as Baptist churches do) (as in Baptist churches). While these two groups will never be able to come together as a single local church or denomination, they can work together on other ministry projects, and individuals within each local body can fellowship and love one another.
